Smart Traffic Light System

Description
 The Smart Traffic Light System is an intelligent traffic control solution designed to optimize signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. Instead of fixed time intervals, this system adapts dynamically to reduce congestion 
and improve traffic flow efficiency.
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of automation and intelligent decision-making in urban traffic management.


Problem Statement
 Traditional traffic lights operate on fixed time intervals regardless of traffic density. This often leads to:
- Unnecessary waiting times
- Traffic congestion
- Fuel wastage
- Increased pollution

 Objectives
 The objective of this project is to develop a smart traffic control system that adjusts signal timing based on traffic density using sensors/image processing techniques
- Detect traffic density using sensors or image processing
- Adjust signal timing dynamically
- Reduce congestion and waiting time
- Improve traffic efficiency
